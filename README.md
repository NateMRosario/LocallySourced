Briefly describe your Problem, Target Demographic, and Hypothesis.
Problem: Traditionally, low-income individuals have trouble obtaining local sourced organic food, which are not available at their local supermarket/bodega, for themselves and/or their children. There are farmers markets that accept SNAP, but they may not know about it. Underprivileged, low-income people with health issues (diabetes, heart disease, obesity) due to poor dieting and lack of access to better food choices/eating habits.
Target Demographic: Low-income NY’ers who use SNAP, especially people who want to start eating healthy, parents looking out for their children.

Hypothesis:
IF:  We provide information about farmers markets that accept SNAP
FOR: Underprivileged, low-income people with health issues (diabetes, heart disease, obesity) due to poor dieting and lack of access to better food choices/eating habits
THEN: they will use our app
BECAUSE: They either want to live a healthier life, or teach their kids to eat healthier/teach them better eating habits
WE KNOW WE’VE SUCCEEDED WHEN: at least 200 users have downloaded the app within a month after launch.

Briefly describe your team's MVP. *
The app will list out all the farmers markets. These markets can be sorted by borough or zipcode. Tapping one of the markets will lead to more information about the market, like address, phone number. There will also be buttons that you can use to get directions to the place, or the Yelp page for the market. The user can also share this location through email or social media. They can also save a list of locations if they want to as well. Depending on the time we have, we may also add ratings/reviews if we finish early.

An app that has a tableview of all the farmers markets - they should be able to filter results by borough or zipcode
tapping on one of the farmers markets will segue to a more detailed info about the place
the maps app and give directions to the location - probably not
use yelp to get get information, like phone number, etc.
link to yelp? - yelp button that leads to yelp app/website
also has ratings or possibly reviews (if we have time sunday)
favorites list - you can save locations you want - do we want to add tips (maybe if we have mvp already and we have time)?
save on file manager?
share - email/social media
